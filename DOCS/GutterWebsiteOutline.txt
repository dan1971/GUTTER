Washington Rain + Pine Needles = Clogged Gutters
Body
 Heavy rain, evergreen needles, moss, and leaves clog gutters fast in Washington.
Overflowing gutters can lead to:
* Roof leaks

* Fascia & siding rot

* Foundation damage

* Basement moisture issues

If water spills over your gutters during rain — they’re already clogged.
